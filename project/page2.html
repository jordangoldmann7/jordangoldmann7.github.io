    <h2>Reason</h2>
    <p>The NLDS has 4 teams which are the Arizona Diamondbacks vs. the Los Angeles Dodgers. This is a really good matchup because the dodgers are the best team in the playoffs and are favored in every game. The Diamondbacks are the underdog and simply dont have the pitching to win the games against the Dodgers.The dodgers end up sweeping the Diamondbacks 3-0. The other matchup is the Cubs against the Nationals. The nationals are favored because they have lost in 5 straight division series. The Cubs end up winning the series and moving on.</p>

    <p>The ALDS consists of the Houston Astros and the Boston Red Sox and the Cleveland indians and the New york Yankees. The Astros were the best team in the A.L. by far and are favored to win the series but the Red Sox are a hard matchup and could have beat them in the series but choked in teh series and let the Astros win. The other matchup was The Cleveland Indians against the New york Yankees. The Indians were favored heavily and the Yankees didnt want to leave without a fight and had nothing to lose. The Yankees end up beating the Indians and create a huge news story.</p>
