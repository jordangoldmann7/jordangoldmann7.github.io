    <h2>Meaning</h2>
    <p>The Wild card is a great way to let the best second place teams into the playoffs and prove themselves to the world that they are capable of making it to the World series.<img src="http://txmgv24xack1i8jje2nayxpr.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/us/files/2017/09/Capture-660x400.jpg"></p>

  <div class="column middle">
    <h2>Reason</h2>
    <p> The wild card teams are the New york yankees and the Minnesota Twins. Then the National league teams are the Arizona diamondbacks and the colorado Rockies. The New york Yankees are the favorite for the American League because they are a great all around team in a hard division and was behind the Red Sox in their division.On the other hand the Twins barley made it into the playoffs and fell to the Yankees. The Twins were a good team but couldnt go further than the division series in my opinion.  </p>

    <p>For the National League, The Arizona diamondbacks were the big favorite because of how good thier offense is in the National League suring the regular season. The Diamondbacks although strong, dont have the pitching staff that they sould. The Colorado Rockies on the other hand were also very close in terms of percentage of winning the wild card because of the same situation as the Diamondbacks and could have wn the game.
