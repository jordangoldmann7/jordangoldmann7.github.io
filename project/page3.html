    <h2>Meaning</h2>
    <p>The Championship series is very important because teis series decides if the best of the best teams go to the World Series and it really depends on the best teams.</p>

    <h2>Reason</h2>
    <p>These are the two best teams in baseball and they have been all year. Apart from one huge winning streak by the Indians, the Astros have been the best team in the American League all season while the Dodgers have had no equal in the National League this year despite an extended late-summer slump. This is the series 2017 deserved and either team could win. This is the best hitting team in baseball against the best pitching team. It's the best left-handed pitcher in Clayton Kershaw and arguably the best right-hander in Justin Verlander.</p>
    <p>In addition to that Houston's best relievers, Joe Musgrove, Luke Gregerson, Ken Giles, Brad Peacock and Francisco Liriano all have good sliders and love to throw them a lot. As good as their pitches are and as much as they like to throw them, the Dodgers have trouble hitting them, too. No batter amongst Los Angeles' regulars has a batting average higher than .262 against sliders while Corey Seager is hitting .221 and Game 7 hero Enrique Hernandez is batting .082.</p>
